# PixelTime

## TODO

- [ ] Add a menu at the startup to select screen size, duration and other options
  - [ ] Screen size selection should probably be by aspect ratio
- [ ] Option to switch between color mode and black and white mode
- [ ] Color mode could use some indicator that is is actually finished
  - Maybe all blocks could change color in the end
- [ ] New mode: Smooth colors. Colors are picked relative to surrounding colors
